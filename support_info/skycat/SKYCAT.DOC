                       SKY CATALOGUE 2000.0, Vol. 1
            Floppy disk version (c) 1989 Sky Publishing Corp.
    For computers running MS-DOS (version 2.0 or higher) with GWBASIC.

     The master diskette (3 diskettes in the 360K version, 2 in the 720K ver-
sion) is not copy-protected, so you can make unlimited backup and working
copies for your own use.  But the software is copyrighted and may not be dis-
tributed to other users, either by itself or as part of any other program, or
uploaded to electronic information services or computer bulletin boards.

     Please leave the write-protect tab in place and immediately make a working
copy of the diskette on another diskette, if you have not already done so.
Then stash the original diskette in a safe place.  The README.1ST file on the
diskette has instructions for unpacking and installing the data.  You need at
least 2.6 megabytes of free space on your hard disk.  (The 2- or 3-diskette
versions require 5.2 MB during installation, but this shrinks back to 2.6 MB
when the files are fully installed.)  In addition, to run the demo programs you
need to have GWBASIC.EXE somewhere on your hard disk.  The AUTOEXEC.BAT file in
your root directory must contain the name of GWBASIC's subdirectory in its PATH
command.  For more on these matters, see your MS-DOS manual.  We do not dis-
tribute GWBASIC or MS-DOS.

     The installation procedure creates a new subdirectory on your computer
called SKYCAT.  It contains five files, as follows:

                           (1) SKYCAT.DAT
                           (2) NAMES.DAT
                           (3) READIT.BAS
                           (4) SKYCAT.BAS
                           (5) SKYCAT.DOC (this file)


     (1) SKYCAT.DAT is the database itself and contains 45,269 records of 52
bytes each.  The objects are in right-ascension order, as in the book, but with
the HD number, absolute magnitude, and luminosity classes omitted.  These
records do not have carriage returns or line feeds in them; they can be read by
a program written in GWBASIC or by a database program that allows access to
files containing fixed-length records.  The format of each record resembles a
"squeezed" line from the book, omitting unnecessary spaces and decimal points,
as follows:

         SSSSSShhmmsssdddmmssaaaaabbbbvvvvccccttrrrrddddfnnnn

where the symbols mean:
             SSSSSS        SAO number
             hhmmsss       Right ascension
             dddmmss       Declination (with + or - in the first or
                              second position)
             aaaaa         Proper motion in right ascension (seconds of
                              time per year), with sign
             bbbb          Proper motion in declination (seconds of arc
                              per year), with sign
             vvvv          V (visual) magnitude, with sign
             cccc          B-V color index, with sign
             tt            Two-letter spectral class (A0, G5, etc.)
             rrrr          Radial velocity in km/sec, with sign
             dddd          Distance in parsecs









             f             Distance flag, where h=mx, l=mn, c=ts
             nnnn          Four digits pointing to the record number
                              in NAMES.DAT where the star's name or a
                              note is stored

Comparing a record to the corresponding star in the printed book will make it
obvious where decimal points belong.  (The two demo programs described below
automatically restore decimal points and spaces for readability.)  All of these
data columns are explained further in the book's Introduction.


     (2) NAMES.DAT is a file containing 6,565 records of 33 bytes each.  Each
record contains a single field of text.  If a star has a Flamsteed number or
Bayer designation, that and the constellation abbreviation are given first.
Greek letters are expressed by a 2- or 3-letter abbreviation (for example,
"alf" for alpha, "omg" for omega -- pretty much self-explanatory).  If a digit
follows a Greek letter, it corresponds to a superscript in the book.  Then
comes any common name the star has, such as Sirius or Polaris.  Variable star
names like "BU Tau" are also listed here.  Finally, if the book includes a dou-
ble star's ADS number, that is given too ("ADS 8630" is abbreviated "A8630").

     The letter flags "v" and "q" are enclosed in parentheses to indicate stars
of known or questionable variability.  The "m" code listed in the book is sup-
pressed here, but the presence of an ADS number is an excellent flag indicating
that the star belongs to a double or multiple star system (physical or opti-
cal).  IMPORTANT NOTE:  Do not try to sort, insert, or delete any records in
NAMES.DAT, because the main database accesses names by their record numbers
here!  Users who want to include additional star names or notes can put them at
the end of NAMES.DAT (beyond 6,565) and edit these new record numbers into the
last four bytes of the star's record in SKYCAT.DAT.  Up to 3,434 notes can be
added this way.


     (3) READIT.BAS is a short and simple GWBASIC program that merely lists
SKYCAT.DAT entries on the screen.  It does a bare minimum of formatting and is
intended only to illustrate how to read the file for the benefit of users writ-
ing their own software.  When you run it, you are asked for a starting and
ending number.  For example, if you type 76, 86 and hit <enter> you will get a
list of the first 11 stars on page 2 of the book, since there are 75 stars per
page.  If you type 45226, 45269 and hit <enter> you will get the last page of
the book.  Objects are listed in the same order as they are found in the book,
except for a few corrections discussed below.  This simple program does not
fetch names; instead, it prints an asterisk (*) at the end of the line for any
star that has a name or note about it in NAMES.DAT.


     (4) SKYCAT.BAS is a much more elaborate menu-driven program.  It il-
lustrates the distinct advantage of a computerized catalogue over the printed
book, because it lets you extract all stars within a circular window of sky as
large as 10 degrees.  If you select option 1, you will see stars listed by SAO
number, position, proper motion, V (visual) magnitude, color index, spectral
class, radial velocity, and distance.  If you select option 2, the last four
columns and the proper motion are omitted to make room for names and notes from
NAMES.DAT in the case of stars that have them.

     After selecting an option, you will be asked to specify the coordinates of
the center of the window and its diameter in degrees (for example, you might









specify the low-power field of view of your telescope's eyepiece or
binoculars).  This could help in identifying stars on photographs or preparing
a finder chart.  Be sure to use commas when entering the hours, minutes, and
seconds of right ascension and the degrees, minutes and seconds of declination.
For example, if you want a window centered at right ascension 12 hours, 6
minutes, 57.3 seconds and south declination 0 degrees, 45 minutes, 12 seconds,
you would type 12, 6, 57.3 and hit <enter>, then -0, 45, 12 and hit <enter>
again.  The search normally takes only a few seconds.  It runs much slower in
the polar regions and can require 15 minutes or more if your window contains
the celestial pole itself.

     To run either of these programs, at the DOS prompt type GWBASIC.  Then,
when you see the OK prompt, type RUN "READIT" or RUN "SKYCAT" to start up the
program.


                      CORRECTIONS TO THE CATALOGUE

     While preparing this machine-readable version of Sky Catalogue 2000.0,
Vol. 1, we corrected some important errors in the printed book.  These involve
the positions of Zeta Sculptoris, Alpha-2 Crucis, and the south-circumpolar
star erroneously listed in the book at right ascension 10h 46m 20s.2 (it should
be 9h 56m 52s.4).  Also corrected here is the right ascension of SAO 128952
(incorrectly printed as 0h 66m 40s.3 when it should have been 0h 46m 40s.3),
along with the declinations of SAO 147221, 69803, and 255456.  After making
these changes, we sorted the entire catalogue again by right ascension.  (If
this had not been done, window-searching would occasionally fail to work.)

     We also corrected some of the physical data for SAO 150058, 235917,
220236, and 228409.  But this machine-readable SkyCat is in no sense a revision
or updating of the printed book.  Such a revision requires a careful reevalua-
tion of reference sources and the cautious sifting of new data being gathered
each year, both by observatories around the world and by spacecraft.  Modern
astronomical references still often show wide disagreement, especially concern-
ing a star's intrinsic brightness (and hence the distance deduced).

     Also, 44 stars have been marked with the note "[Delete this star]" -- item
6,565 in NAMES.DAT.  Some of them are the duplicates or "ghosts" discussed in
the book's Introduction, while others are perfectly good stars whose magnitudes
have turned out to be fainter than 8.0.  The records themselves have not been
corrected or blanked out, but the SKYCAT.BAS program automatically skips over
them.  If you really want to see them, delete line 830 of the program.
