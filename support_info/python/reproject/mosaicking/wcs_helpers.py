    Given one or more images, return an optimal WCS projection object and

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_data : iterable
        One or more input datasets to include in the calculation of the final
        WCS. This should be an iterable containing one entry for each dataset,
        where a single dataset is one of:

            * The name of a FITS file
            * An `~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object
            * An image HDU object such as a `~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`,
              `~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU`, or `~astropy.io.fits.CompImageHDU`
              instance
            * A tuple where the first element is a `~numpy.ndarray` and the
              second element is either a `~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
              `~astropy.io.fits.Header` object

    frame : str or `~astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`
        The coordinate system for the final image (defaults to the frame of
        the first image specified)
    auto_rotate : bool
        Whether to rotate the header to minimize the final image area (if
        `True`, requires shapely>=1.6 to be installed)
    projection : str
        Three-letter code for the WCS projection
    resolution : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The resolution of the final image. If not specified, this is the
        smallest resolution of the input images.
    reference : `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`
        The reference coordinate for the final header. If not specified, this
        is determined automatically from the input images.

    Returns
    -------
    wcs : :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS`
        The optimal WCS determined from the input images.
    shape : tuple
        The optimal shape required to cover all the output.
