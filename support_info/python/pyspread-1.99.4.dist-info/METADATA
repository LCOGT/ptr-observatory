## Other platforms

### Prerequisites

Get the prerequisites:
- Python (>=3.6)
- PyQt5 (>=5.10) (must include PyQtSvg)
- numpy (>=1.1)

and if needed the suggested modules:
- matplotlib (>=1.1.1)
- pyenchant (>=1.1)
- pip (>=18)

Should the package pkg_resources be missing in your setup (e.g. on Ubuntu),
then you may need to reinstall pip for Python3.

### With pip

The example installs the dependencies for the current user. Make sure that
you are using the Python3 version of pip.

```bash
pip3 install --user requirements.txt
```

## Getting the bleeding edge version from the code repository

Note that there may unfixed bugs if you use the latest repository version.
You may want to check the CI, which comprises unit tests at
`https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread/pipelines`.

Get the latest tarball or zip at https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread or
clone the git repo at `https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread.git`

# Starting pyspread

With an installation via pip, distutils or your OS's installer, simply run
```
$ pyspread

In order to start pyspread without installation directly from the cloned
repository or the extracted tarball or zip, run
```
$ ./bin/pyspread
```
or
