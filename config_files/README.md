# Config files

Some config files are stored here for development convenience. Eventually, we should remove them from the master repository and include a template for users to fill out instead. 

The config used on normal startup is `config.py`. 

The config used on running in simulator mode is `config_simulator.py`.

To run using any other file, duplicate it and rename to `config.py`.
